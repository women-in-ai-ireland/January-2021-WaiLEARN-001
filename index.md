## Analysis of Spotify Data

### The Project
Spotify is the largest audio streaming and media provider in the world i.e. it provides digital music, podcasts and video streaming services. It has 345 million active users till date and helpful for the artists to reach their audience and hence, can imagine the amount of data Spotify collects. 
In this project we have explored and analysed Spotify dataset which is available on Kaggle to understand how music has changed over the period of time and to do sentiment analysis for the most popular artist TheBeatles. As it is quite tricky to analyze and understand large datasets, visualizing the data to understand trends and features in the dataset can be of great help. 
Following are the steps we have performed in this project to accomplish the project objective:
Exploratory Data Analysis in Tableau
Understanding how the audio features changed over time against popularity by creating animation in Tableau
Finding out the most popular artist till date.

Twitter Sentiment Analysis in R
To understand what people are talking about #TheBeatles through tweets.
Location analysis of twitter users tweeting about #TheBeatles
The sentiment analysis of #TheBeatles i.e. whether it is positive or negative

Statistical Analysis on three different artists in SPSS 
Descriptive analysis
Normality test 
Kruskal-Wallis test 
Discover if there are any correlations between year and popularity

Generating Insights
Dashboard creation in Tableau to understand more about artists.
Generating insights of the most popular song TheBeatles by performing Twitter Sentiment Analysis.

The analysis done can help understand some interesting trends of songs over the period from 1921 to 2021 and understand how music has changed over time.
